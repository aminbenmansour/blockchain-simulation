# blockchain-simulation

New year new resolutions, never thought of a better beginning.

The whole world is fascinated by Crytocurrency, NFTs, Decentraland and DeFi and waiting for the next IT revolution AKA web 3.0 to happen and migrating to the decentralized world

### goals 

Blockchain as the backbone of all of these technologies is fundamental to understand.

We have been hearing about blockchain for about a while. but understanding Blockchains isn’t easy, or at least wasn’t for me.
I trudged through dense videos, followed porous tutorials, and dealt with the amplified frustration of too few examples.

In this repo we will be learning by doing, It forces me to deal with the subject matter at a code level, which gets it sticking. If you do the same, at the end of this guide you’ll have a functioning blockchain with a solid grasp of how they work.

### before we get started

Remember that a blockchain is an *immutable, sequential chain of records* called **Blocks**. They can contain *transactions, files or any data you like*, really. But the important thing is that they’re chained together using *hashes*.
